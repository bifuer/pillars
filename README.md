# [![Pillars - make it easy ](http://pillarsjs.com/img/pillars.png)](http://pillarsjs.com/)

# Welcome to **Pillars.js**, a modular framework for Web Development in Node.js.

With a simple and modular approach lets you introduce in Node.js with a soft learning curve, if you're an advanced JS/Node developer, get an organized and efficient environment. Pillars has a powerful state control that lets you manage your application in a completely new way.

## Current Status

> *Pillars.js is still an Beta version. Now we are writing reference, test, tutorials...*
> We are working on the English version of the reference. Sorry for the inconvenience, if you have a good knowledge of Spanish and English would be a wonderful help to us your contribution. The entire site pillarsjs.com is available (Spanish) in [pillars.docs](http://github.com/bifuer/pillars.docs) repository. Please contact us!
> **Very soon you'll see Node web development in a different way.**

> For English speakers, sample codes are available fully commented in English [overview](https://github.com/bifuer/pillars/blob/master/examples/overview/app.js).

## Scope

- **HTTP Negotiation**
  - **Send files** with *compression*, *cache control* and automatic ranges (byte-serving compatible and **recovery downloads**).

  - File upload Management *(integrated with formidable)*.
  - Full HTTP Headers parsing, with priority management for headers as *accept* and *languages*.

  - Automatic **Compression** in response.
  - **Cookies** Management.

- **Controllers and environment**
  - **Dynamic environment** in runtime, allows change the structure while application is running.

  - **Plugins** allow expand controllers possibilities and modifying the system operation.
  - Named controllers, give organization and control over the environment.
  - **Inheritance** system for controllers trees

- **Internacionalization**
  - Full **i18n** integration.

  - Language management of request automatic.

- **Utils**
  - *Templated*, adds **support to any template engine** and cache managed centrally.
